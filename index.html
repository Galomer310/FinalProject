    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p><strong> and Family: </strong> Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, in the Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). He was one of five children. His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest and writer, and his mother, Georgina Đuka Tesla, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances, an early influence on Tesla's inventive mind.</p>
    <p><strong> Education: </strong>  Tesla showed an early aptitude for mathematics and engineering. He attended the Technical University of Graz, Austria, and later studied at the University of Prague. Although he did not complete a degree, his studies provided a strong foundation in physics and mathematics.</p>

    <h3>Career Beginnings</h3>
    <p> <strong>Early Work:</strong> Tesla worked in the telephony and electrical engineering fields before emigrating to the United States in 1884. He initially worked for Thomas Edison, but the two had a falling out due to differing opinions on electricity (AC vs. DC). </p>
    <p> <strong>AC vs. DC:</strong>  Tesla became a staunch advocate of alternating current (AC) systems, which he believed were more efficient and practical than Edison's direct current (DC) systems.</p>

    <h3>Major Contributions and Inventions</h3>
    <p> <strong>Tesla Coil:</strong>  Invented in 1891, the Tesla Coil is a high-frequency transformer that produces high-voltage, low-current electricity. It is used in radio technology, wireless transmission experiments, and educational demonstrations.</p>
    <p> <strong>Induction Motor and Polyphase AC:</strong>  Tesla developed the induction motor and polyphase AC systems, which were critical for the widespread adoption of AC power. These inventions formed the basis of modern electrical power distribution.</p>
    <p> <strong>Niagara Falls Project:</strong>  Tesla’s work was instrumental in the development of the hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls, which was the first major demonstration of AC power's viability.</p>
